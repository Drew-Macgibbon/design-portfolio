excerpt: "This proved a bit more challenging than I initially thought. There was a range of different Lottie libraries to choose from and packages for playing the files. The first two I tried wound up being bad matches for Nuxt, which was a minor setback"

### Why

With the improvements to Javascript and the V8 engine (what powers Chrome) over the past few years, it's becoming nessacary to incorporate 3d designs into your websites. Having little experience myself I thought it a good idea to learn a new skill and showcase the process.

#### Learnings

Working with Lottie players was a first for me, usually I'd just use MP4 or GIF files. Lottie files are significantly smaller than those options which is a big positive. Now that I know how to use them I will avoid relying on GiFs and MP4 files. 


#### What would I improve with more time?
- Add more lottie files
- Allow the user to change the speed of the animations
- Potentially allow the user to change the lottie colors
- Add a sticky navbar like on the patterns page.
- Refactor code
