In an era where businesses come and go, the backbone of every successful company lies not just in
its products or services, but in its deeply-rooted values. These values not only serve as guiding
principles for decision-making but also help in creating a unique company culture that stands out.
At Incubrain, our values are more than just words on paperâ€”they're the essence of who we are and how
we operate.

## **Innovation**

We foster a culture where new ideas and unconventional thinking are not just welcomed, but actively
encouraged. We're not afraid to step into the unknown, embracing the creative process and all the
unique solutions it brings.

## **Ownership**

We believe that every employee is a stakeholder. We don't just do tasks; we take full responsibility
for the outcomes. From profits to mistakes, we share everything. Our commitment is to go beyond
'business as usual' and truly own our roles within the company.

## **Resourcefulness**

When faced with challenges, we don't back down. We exhaust all avenues, tap into our creativity, and
persevere until we find a solution. The phrase "it can't be done" isn't in our vocabulary. Instead,
we say, "We'll find a way."

## **Resilience**

We're made of grit. We understand that success isn't linear, and we're not discouraged by obstacles
or setbacks. We push forward, meet deadlines, and maintain our 'never give up' attitude, no matter
the circumstance.

## **Fundamental Improvement**

We approach problems by breaking them down to their most basic elements. Using a first-principles
perspective, we build solutions from the ground up, always looking for ways to enhance and improve.
We firmly believe that there's always room to get better, and that every situation, good or bad,
presents a learning opportunity.

## **Insatiable Curiosity**

We're lifelong learners who thrive on questions. If we don't know something, we ask. Our constant
thirst for knowledge fuels our innovations and drives us to dig deeper, understanding the 'why'
behind every 'what'.

## **Transparency**

We keep an open house. From discussions and decisions to roadmaps and codebases, we ensure that
transparency is maintained. We believe that everyone's opinion matters, fostering an inclusive
environment where employees are part of our key business decisions.

## **Collaboration**

We work together, combining our skills and knowledge to deliver end-to-end products and features. We
believe that the best solutions come from group discussions and collective inputs. We share ideas
and learn from each other, focusing on achieving common goals.

## **Passionate Engagement**

We do more than just work - we pour our hearts into what we do. We believe that passion is the spark
that drives excellence, innovation, and satisfaction. When we love what we do, we do it better.

## **Relentless Pursuit of Excellence**

We are obsessed with quality. Every product we create, every service we deliver, is a testament to
our commitment to excellence. We continuously set and surpass high standards, delivering nothing but
the best.

## In Summary:

Values are the bedrock of any sustainable company. They shape our behaviors, influence our
decisions, and form the heart of our identity. At Incubrain, our values are not mere tick-box
exercises. They are living principles that influence our day-to-day operations and long-term vision.
By holding these values at the forefront of our efforts, we aim to not only achieve business success
but also to make a lasting, positive impact on the world around us. As we move forward, we invite
all our stakeholders, from employees to partners, to join us in upholding these ideals, ensuring
