## Introduction

explain that this article is purely a thought experiment, and that it's not to be taken as fact.
We're not experts in the field of healthcare, we just have a passion for the future and want to explore what it might look like.
We mean no offence to anyone, this is purely our opinion based on available data and our own research.
Healthcare is a broad topic, this article will be updated routinely to cover most areas, for now we're just scratching the surface.

Revising the list with the assumption that all diseases have been cured changes the focus to purely age-related biological and physiological factors:

1. **Genetic Factors**: The accumulation of genetic mutations and telomere shortening remains a key factor. Each time a cell divides, telomeres shorten, eventually leading to cellular senescence. This natural genetic process is a fundamental limit to cell replication and regeneration.

2. **Cellular Senescence**: Independent of disease, cells reach a point where they can no longer divide (the Hayflick limit). The accumulation of these senescent cells contributes to the aging process and the decline in the regenerative capacity of tissues.

3. **Oxidative Stress**: This is a byproduct of normal metabolism and leads to cellular damage over time. The accumulation of oxidative damage is a critical factor in the aging process, affecting DNA, proteins, and lipids.

4. **Metabolic Decline**: Metabolism slows down with age, affecting cellular energy conversion and leading to an accumulation of harmful waste products. This decline impacts overall bodily efficiency and contributes to the aging process.

5. **Impaired Autophagy**: The body's reduced efficiency in clearing out damaged cells and cellular components through autophagy contributes to aging. This decline in cellular 'housekeeping' leads to the accumulation of cellular damage over time.

6. **Systemic Inflammation**: Chronic low-grade inflammation, or "inflammaging," accelerates the aging process. This inflammation can cause progressive damage to tissues and organs, even in the absence of specific diseases.

7. **Hormonal Changes**: Hormonal shifts due to aging impact a wide range of bodily functions, including metabolism, cognitive function, and mood. These changes are a natural part of aging and affect overall health and vitality.

8. **Decline in Immune Function (Immunosenescence)**: The weakening of the immune system with age is a natural process. While curing diseases might mitigate some effects of this decline, the reduced ability to fight new infections and respond to vaccines remains a challenge.

9. **Stem Cell Exhaustion**: The diminished number and functionality of stem cells with age lead to a reduced capacity for tissue repair and regeneration. This decline is a significant factor in the natural aging process.

10. **Neurodegeneration**: Even without diseases like Alzheimer's, the brain's ability to function and regenerate diminishes with age. This includes general cognitive decline and a reduction in the brain's plasticity.

In this revised scenario, the fundamental biological processes of aging remain the primary limiting factors to lifespan. Although curing all diseases would undoubtedly extend life expectancy, these inherent biological processes of aging would still pose a ceiling to the human lifespan. Overcoming these would require not just curing diseases but fundamentally altering the human aging process at a cellular and molecular level.

## Long Term (2033-2040)

### Genetic Disease Eradication

### Gene Editing

### Paralysis Reversal

### Brain Computer Interfaces

### Regenerative Medicine
