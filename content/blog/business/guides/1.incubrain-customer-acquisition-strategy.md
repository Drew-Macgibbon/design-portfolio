**Keyword and Competitor Research: Gauging the Pulse of Your Market**

Before diving deep into the vast sea of content creation and business strategies, it's crucial to
understand the lay of the land – or in digital terms, the landscape of your market. Keyword and
competitor research isn't just a preliminary step; it's a cornerstone of effective business
planning. Why? Because it offers a clear window into what your potential audience is seeking and the
scale of that demand.

Here's why this research is paramount and steps to conduct it effectively:

3. **_Estimating Your Potential Audience:_**
4. **_Check In Regularly:_**

By dedicating time and resources to thorough keyword and competitor research, you're not just
setting the stage for impactful content creation; you're building a foundation for informed and
strategic business decisions. Remember, in the digital world, knowledge isn't just power; it's a
competitive edge.

## **Content Creation: You Know You Should Do More!**

The age-old adage, "Content is King," remains relevant. But in today's saturated digital landscape,
the manner in which we approach content can make all the difference.

#### Creating content, where to start?? We suggest 2 strategies:

1. **Documenting:** Instead of being paralyzed by the pressure to 'create' from scratch, shift your
   mindset towards 'documenting.' By documenting your journey, processes, research, and learnings,
   you automatically sidestep the daunting challenge of brainstorming entirely novel ideas. It
   provides a continuous stream of content that resonates with authenticity.
2. **Improve Existing Content:** You don't need to be original, you just need to be better than the
   competition. Find the top 10 articles on a topic and make yours better. This is called the
   skyscraper technique.

**Imposter syndrome is a real thing!** Just remember that everyone is wrong sometimes, and that's
okay. The important thing is to keep learning and improving. If you don't put yourself out there,
you may never uncover these gaps in your knowledge which will hurt your business in the long-run.

#### Where Should You Create?

First and foremost you MUST create written content for your business blog, writing things down helps
to solidify your understanding of a topic and helps you to communicate your ideas more clearly and
will boost your chances of ranking in search engines dramatically. This content can then be
re-worked into other forms of content such as videos, podcasts, infographics, etc.

Which social media platform(s) should you choose? The answer is simple, the ones you use the most in
your personal life.

**If you're a solo-founder choose one and focus on it, if you have a team then focus on mastering 2
platforms before expanding.**

#### How Much Should You Create?

---

The amount of content you create will directly reflect in your results, if you increase from 2 to 10
pieces of content per week you should see around a 5x increase probably more as you'll continue to
strengthen your content creation muscles the more you create. Although more is better, quality of
information and consiceness is key. If you take 10 minutes to explain something that could be done
in 1 minute, you'll lose your audience.

#### Content Is Never Perfect!

With blog posts you can continue to update them as you learn more about a topic,
