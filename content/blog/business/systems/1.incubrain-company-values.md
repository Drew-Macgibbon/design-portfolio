In a world where change is the only constant, let's talk about the secret sauce of business success – it's not just what you sell, it's what you stand for. Enter the world of values, the unsung heroes behind the scenes of thriving company cultures. They're like your business's North Star, guiding decisions and shaping a workplace that's more than just desks and coffee machines.

Studies after studies, including those cited by Forbes, nod in agreement: strong company values are like a magic potion for productivity, creativity, and profitability. Think of them as your business's superpower!

CEOs and CFOs are onto this – more than half of them, to be precise. They see how culture influences the big stuff: growth, value, and those dollar signs. And HR leaders? A whopping 80% of them are rolling out the red carpet for employee recognition programs, making values more than just fancy words on a website.

Haiilo tells us that 37% of employees put a high price on recognition, seeing it as their ladder to success. Meanwhile, Bultin's got a number to wow you – 88% of employees believe a strong company culture is key to business victory.

But wait, there's a twist. Jobvite drops a truth bomb – 15% of job seekers walk away from offers if the company culture feels off. Ouch! Gallup adds another layer, revealing a gap between values and daily work life. And here's a number to ponder: 35% of U.S. workers would say "no thanks" to their dream job if the company culture doesn't vibe with them. Robert Half and TINYpulse back this up, highlighting that a mismatch in culture can lead employees to the exit.

So, what's the takeaway? Rock-solid, well-communicated values are like magnets – they attract talent, boost the workplace atmosphere, and pave the way for innovation and long-term success.

At Incubrain, we're more than just our products – we're a blend of ethics and leadership. Our values are the heartbeat of our company.

Diving into the world of values, the Harvard Business Review, through Patrick M. Lencioni's insights, takes a hard look at corporate values statements. Lencioni points out that many of these statements miss the mark, sometimes doing more harm than good. He takes Enron as a classic case – a company that talked the talk but definitely didn't walk the walk.

Lencioni lays out four commandments for values that truly mean something:

1. **Know Your Value Types**: It's like a value buffet – core, aspirational, permission-to-play, and accidental. Mixing them up is like adding too much salt – it just doesn't work.

2. **Authenticity is King**: Skip the generic. Make your values uniquely you, woven into the fabric of your culture.

3. **Leaders, Take the Wheel**: This isn't a job for HR alone. It's a top-tier mission.

4. **Live Your Values**: Don't just frame them on the wall. Make them a part of everything – hiring, working, even saying goodbye.

It's a tough road, but the payoff is big. Real values set you apart and give your team a flag to rally around.
