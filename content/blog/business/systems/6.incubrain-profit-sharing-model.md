## Profit Sharing vs Gain Sharing

### Different Options to consider

- **Profit Sharing:** we could allow employees to choose how much they want to invest back into
  Incubrain, to be vested after a certain number of years.
- **Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP):** could have a percentage of profit sharing invested back
  into the company and vested after 10 years, meaning they have control over those stocks if they
  stay for longer than 10 years. This could also be used as a type of retirement plan, although it's
  quite risky.

An Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) is a benefit allowing employees to own company shares and
profit from their value growth. These IRS-approved plans let employees accumulate stock during
employment and cash them upon departure or retirement. ESOPs, covering only a portion of the
company's stock, aim to link employee motivation to financial success without altering company
management or share-based voting power. However, business owners can use ESOPs to redistribute
voting shares to employees if desired.

- **Retirement Plans:** government retirement plans
- **Employee equity program:** government retirement plans
  - **Employee stock purchase plan:** government retirement plans
  - **Employee ownership trusts:** government retirement plans
- **Match Investment Into Company:** for example, it you invest $100 of your salary one week, we
  will also add $100.
- **Group/Individual Performance Bonuses:** could have employees anonymously vote on who they think
  is the best performer, and give them bonuses, would need to somehow factor out popularity bias.

## Different Employee Ownership Models

| Ownership Form                   | Typical Companies                                             | Primary Uses                                                              | Tax Benefits                                                        | Employee Inclusion                            | Equity Allocation                                         | Payment Timing                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| ESOPs                            | Established companies transitioning ownership.                | Ownership transition, employee incentives.                                | Capital gains deferral, tax-deductible contributions.               | Broad inclusion, with eligibility conditions. | Based on compensation or level formula.                   | Post-termination, with conditions. |
| Equity Grants                    | C, S corporations, or LLCs.

| Employee Ownership Trusts (EOTs) | Companies preserving legacy or avoiding ESOP rules.           | Culture preservation, business transitions.                               | Deductible profit sharing, potential trust contribution deductions. | Mostly inclusive.                             | Trust owns shares, profit sharing by company.             | Profit shares paid annually.       |

#### **Note**:

- ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans), EOTs, Equity Grants, and Worker Cooperatives are
  structures for employee ownership, each fitting different company profiles and purposes.
- Tax benefits vary significantly, with ESOPs and Worker Cooperatives offering capital gains
  deferrals, and differing tax treatments for companies and employees.
- Employee inclusion and equity allocation also vary, with ESOPs and Worker Cooperatives being more
  inclusive, while Equity Grants and EOTs provide more discretion to companies.
- Payment timing is set by company rules in Equity Grants, annually in EOTs and Worker Cooperatives,
  and post-termination in ESOPs.

- **Goal of Profit-Sharing**:

  - Understand the rationale behind implementing a profit-sharing scheme in a company.

- **Form of Rewards**:

  - Determine the medium through which rewards are disbursed.

- **Coverage**:

  - Identify the proportion of employees covered under the profit-sharing plan.

- **Reward Distribution Formula**:

  - Establish the formula for reward distribution to individual employees, considering:
    - Whether the reward amount should be formula-driven, manager-discretionary, or a combination of
      both.
    - The source of data for evaluating formula results, e.g., financial or managerial accounting.
    - The form in which rewards are distributed to employees, such as cash or other forms.
    - The basis of distribution, e.g., proportionate to salary, equal profit-shares, length of
      service, or a combination of methods.
    - Whether individual performance should influence profit-sharing.
    - Whether the formula should be target-based or relative.
    - The period for which the formula is evaluated.
    - The frequency of formula evaluation.

- **Timing and Frequency**:

  - Determine the timing and frequency of reward disbursement.

- **Concurrent Use**:

  - Understand the concurrent use of profit-sharing with other performance-related rewards.

- **Relative Importance**:
  - Ascertain the importance of rewards from profit-sharing plans in relation to fixed income, or
    more generally, the relative importance of (planned) variable rewards to fixed income.

Since the 1980s, profit-sharing has almost disappeared from large corporations. That’s largely
because of a change in the American corporation that began with a wave of hostile takeovers and
corporate restructurings in the 1980s. Raiders like Carl Icahn, Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken
targeted companies they thought could deliver higher returns if their costs were cut. Since payrolls
were the highest cost, raiders set about firing workers, cutting pay, automating as many jobs as
possible, fighting unions, moving jobs to states with lower labor costs and outsourcing jobs abroad.
To prevent being taken over, C.E.O.s began doing the same.

#### Ideas

- We could have employees pay for half of their personal development / upskilling as ownership, it
  would also discourage unessasary spending.
