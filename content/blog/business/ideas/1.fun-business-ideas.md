What if we created a web scraper that uses ML to learn how pages are structured so it can magically
scrape any page? If it's a complex page you could attach a screenshot to the request and it could
learn from that.

what if we had a web scraper that takes in a list of websites that perform extremely well with
conversions, then it screenshots each one and uses ML to learn how the page is designed, the copy is
extracted as data in a structured format. It then learns how to design a page that looks and
converts on a similar manner. Once you have this model, users could simply input information about
their business, such as; product photos and info, brand colors and feel, business vision etc. This
could output a design like in figma, then you could export them as Tailwind components, expanding to
frameworks like Nuxt and Next.
