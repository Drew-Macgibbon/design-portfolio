Zod is a JavaScript library for validating and parsing structured data. It is designed to be
expressive, simple, and easy to use.

With Zod, you can define a schema that describes the structure of the data that you want to
validate. You can then use the schema to validate and parse data, and Zod will ensure that the data
conforms to the schema. If the data is invalid, Zod will return an error with information about the
validation errors.

Zod is particularly useful for validating user input in web applications, such as form submissions
or JSON payloads in HTTP requests. It can be used in any JavaScript environment, including Node.js
and the browser.

Below is an example of how I used Zod to validate the data from the Nasa Image of the Day API while
building the AstroTribe app.

```javascript
import { z } from 'zod'

const imageObject = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  explanation: z.string(),
  date: z.string(),
  url: z.string(),
  hdurl: z.string(),
  media_type: z.string(),
  copyright: z.string(),
  service_version: z.string()
})

type NasaImg = z.infer<typeof imageObject>
let nasaImg: NasaImg | undefined = undefined

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  if (nasaImg !== undefined) return { nasaImg }

  const unvalidated = await $fetch(
    'https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=qVu1erjdjYJLfLLALZyIz3EfYxOerf29waltn3PM'
  )

  const data: NasaImg = imageObject.parse(unvalidated)
  nasaImg = data

  return {
    nasaImg
  }
})
```
