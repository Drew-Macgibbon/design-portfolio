### TL;DR

MLFX (Machine Learning Forex) is a Single Page Application (SPA) SaaS web application built using Vue3, Typescript, Node and Postgres.

MLFX uses a **proprietary machine learning algorithm** to provide Forex signals to users for a monthly subscription. Users can take trades in a simulated environment, monitor their performance over time, learn from other traders and once profitable switch to live-trading.

This app, outside of the algorithm, was was created from idea to end by me, it's the first project that helped me to solidify all my business and development knowledge. Although the business is on hold for now, I still work on it in my free time.

##### Original Solution

```javascript
function findOddInt(input) {
  const count = {}
  // cycle through input integers
  for (const element of input)
  {
    // if integer exists add 1 to count
    if (count[element]) count[element] += 1  
    // add first count if it does not exist
    else count[element] = 1
  }

  // cycle through tallied integers
  Object.keys(count).forEach(key =>
  {
    // return integer if count is odd
    if ((count[key] % 2) !== 0) return Number(key)
  })

  // return null if no odd count found
  return null
}
  ```
