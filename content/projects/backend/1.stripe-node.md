  "Writing maintanable backend code is challenging, this is some code I wrote 2 weeks into my
  programming journey. Since then I've improved a LOT, but this is a good example where I started."

This is a showcase of implementing Stripe payments into a Node.js application. The application used
suscriptions, Stripe Checkout, and the customer portal to allow users to manage their subscriptions.

Stripe is the reason I got into programming, a developer I'd hired on a part-time basis had been
struggling to integrate Stripe into our application for 5 months... 2 weeks later I'd learned
Javascript, Vue, Node.js and had implemented Stripe. I was hooked.

Needless to say the developer is no longer with us. Below is some of the first code I ever wrote in
any language.

Looking back there's obvious flaws, now I'd definitely write it in Typescript, use something like
Zod for data validation. That being said, it's a good
example of how quickly I can learn when motivated and my evolution as a developer.

Below shows the full lifecycle of the Stripe Checkout function separated into routes and
controllers.

```javascript
import Stripe from 'stripe'
import env from '../config.js'

async function stripeCheckout(req, res) {
  const stripe = new Stripe(env.STRIPE_SECRET)

  let { priceId, customerId } = req.body

  // If in development, use test price and customer
  if (env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    priceId = 'price_1InBZfDhvT9geSyOLlbiYCYB'
    customerId = 'cus_LVetyg6kfVg35x'
  }

  // create subscription session
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    mode: 'subscription',
    payment_method_types: ['card'],
    customer: customerId,
    line_items: [
      {
        price: priceId,
        quantity: 1
      }
    ],
    allow_promotion_codes: true,
    success_url: `${env.BASE_URL}/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
    cancel_url: `${env.BASE_URL}/payment-failed?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
  })

  res.status(200).send(session)
}

export default stripeCheckout
```

I'm a big believer that functions should be small and do one thing well. This is why I've separated
the routes, controllers and functions into their own files. This makes it easy to maintain and test.
This slightly increases the debelopment cost upfront but makes for a much more maintainable
application.

There's some obvious room for improvement in the above code. Let's see how we can improve it.

```javascript
const initializeCheckout = (priceId, customerId, env, paymentProcessor) => {
  return paymentProcessor.checkout.sessions.create({
    // this is now the only code we need to change if we switch payment processor
    mode: 'subscription',
    payment_method_types: ['card'],
    customer: customerId,
    line_items: [
      {
        price: priceId,
        quantity: 1
      }
    ],
    allow_promotion_codes: true,
    success_url: `${env.BASE_URL}/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
    cancel_url: `${env.BASE_URL}/payment-failed?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
  })
}

async function paymentCheckout(req, res, depend) {
  // extract Stripe, dev check, and env functionality
  // add packages via dependency injection
  // make function interchangable, eg. paymentCheckout vs stripeCheckout
  // handle errors and logging
  // that looks much better! (this code is untested)

  let { priceId, customerId } = depend.isDevelopment ? depend.devUser : req.body

  const { data, error } = await initializeCheckout(
    priceId,
    customerId,
    depend.env,
    depend.paymentProcessor
  )

  if (error) {
    depend.logger.error(error)
    // handle error on the frontend
    res.status(error.status).send(error)
  }

  depend.logger.info(data)
  res.status(200).send(data)
}

export default paymentCheckout
```

We could also add unit testing and data/type validation / write the code in Typescript to improve it
further. I've left this out for brevity.

Next we'll look at the routes and controllers. I won't be refactoring any of this code.

```javascript
// import all the controllers and export them as a single object
import stripeCheckout from './stripe/stripeCheckout.js'

const controller = {
  stripe: {
    checkout: stripeCheckout
  }
}

export default controller
```

```javascript
// using the controller I can easily manage all the API routes
import express from 'express'
import controller from '../controllers/index.js'

// middleware
import useExpressJson from '../middleware/useJson.js'
import useExpressRaw from '../middleware/useRaw.js'
import checkJwt from '../middleware/checkJwt.js'

const router = express.Router()

router.post('/customer-portal', useExpressJson, checkJwt, controller.stripe.customerPortal)

router.post('/checkout', useExpressJson, checkJwt, controller.stripe.checkout)

export default router
```

finally we import these routes into our main app file and initiate the API with express.

```javascript
import express from 'express'
import stripeRoutes from './api/routes/stripe.js'

const app = express()

app.use('/stripe', stripeRoutes)
```

And there you have it, a simple Stripe integration and my first ever Node.js application after 2
weeks of programming experience.
