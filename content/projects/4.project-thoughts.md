### TL;DR

1. `[7]`{lang=js} should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
2. `[0]`{lang=js} should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
3. `[1,1,2]`{lang=js} should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
4. `[0,1,0,1,0]`{lang=js} should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
5. `[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1]`{lang=js} should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).

MLFX (Machine Learning Forex) is a SaaS web application built using Vue3, Nuxt3, Node and Postgres.

The application aims to provide hedgefund-level trading tools to everyday traders who subscribe to our service. We're also working on the social trading aspect which allows more experienced traders to provide feedback to beginner traders, essentially mentoring them.

This app was completely developed, designed and marketed by me.

I had to complete the following:

- Authentication/Authorization
- API Development
- Database Design/Implementation
- Designing the app & UI/UX
- Writing copy & articles
- Recording marketing videos
- Charting real-time data
- Manipulating data with SQL
- Optimizing for SEO/Performance
- Node backend for secure API calls using JWT
- Hasura for graphQL API, Business logic and Database CRUD




##### Original Solution

```javascript
function findOddInt(input) {
  const count = {}
  // cycle through input integers
  for (const element of input)
  {
    // if integer exists add 1 to count
    if (count[element]) count[element] += 1  
    // add first count if it does not exist
    else count[element] = 1
  }

  // cycle through tallied integers
  Object.keys(count).forEach(key =>
  {
    // return integer if count is odd
    if ((count[key] % 2) !== 0) return Number(key)
  })

  // return null if no odd count found
  return null
}
  ```
