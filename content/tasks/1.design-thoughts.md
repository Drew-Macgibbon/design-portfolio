# How I design

Although design is not my strongsuit, the advent of [Tailwind]() has considerably imporved my design quality/speed and provided many libraries such as:

- [Vuetify 3](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/)
- [Tailwind Kit](https://tailwinduikit.com/)
- [Hyper UI](https://www.hyperui.dev/)
- [Kitwind](https://kitwind.io/products/kometa/components)

This has allowed me to create good looking, custom designs without the need of a designer and in a fraction of the time it would have taken me before. Needless to say, I'm a big fan!

Whenever I have time, I browse the [Awesome Design repo](https://github.com/gztchan/awesome-design) and learn something new to improve my design skills.
