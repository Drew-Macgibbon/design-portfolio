excerpt: I really liked the layout of the Fontawesome website, and have used their icons in the past. This was a good oportunity to learn how to implement the icons with Nuxt 3

### Why

Since i'd already included the Fontawesome package while working on the Patterns tab, I decided it would be a good oportunity to incorporate some icons into the website as well. I did all the design and functionality from scratch

##### Learnings

Click to copy - Previously I'd used `document.execCommand()` when copying to clipboard. This is almost depreciated in favour of the new `clipboard` API, something I had to learn although not too difficult.


#### What would I improve with more time?
- Add click feedback so it's obvious the content is copied to clipboard
- Add ability to change color of icons
- Add ability to change background shape and color (circle/square etc.)
- Add more icons and a filter menu
- Refactor code
