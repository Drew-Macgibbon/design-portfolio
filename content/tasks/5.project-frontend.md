## Why

I took inspiration from the [magic pattern design](https://www.magicpattern.design/tools/css-backgrounds) website and used their patterns for this page.

For this page to function correctly I needed the use of [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/use-with/vue/) and the [Vanilla Picker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vanilla-picker)

For the first few tasks I complete I'll rate my speed and **how I wasted time!!**

#### So... how did I waste time?

- I used a CSS grid with specified columns for 2 breakpoints after wasting too much time trying to figure out how to get and auto-flow/wrap grid working with tailwind.
- Getting the color picker working
- Not batching time with specific tasks, eg. design, functionality.

### Changes

I decided to complete this task without the ability to copy the HEX code to clipboard

### What did I learn

- How to make reactive variables from Vue trasition over to CSS variables

### Time taken | est | actual 4.25 hours

#### Learnings

Working with Lottie players was a first for me, usually I'd just use MP4 or GIF files. Lottie files are significantly smaller than those options which is a big positive. Now that I know how to use them I will avoid relying on GiFs and MP4 files. 


#### What would I improve with more time?
- Add more lottie files
- Allow the user to change the speed of the animations
- Potentially allow the user to change the lottie colors
- Add a sticky navbar like on the patterns page.
- Refactor code
