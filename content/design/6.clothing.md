Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.
There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

1. `[7]`{lang=js} should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
2. `[0]`{lang=js} should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
3. `[1,1,2]`{lang=js} should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
4. `[0,1,0,1,0]`{lang=js} should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
5. `[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1]`{lang=js} should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).
