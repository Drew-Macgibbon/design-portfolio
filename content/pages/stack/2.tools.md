# Why do I like open-source?

Simply put, it's pushing humanity forward!

Although some people try to put a negative spin on things, criticising large companies for using
open-source software. The eternal optimist within rejects their arguments. To me, a free option
pressures big businesses to improve their comparative services to stay competitive.

So yes, big business is taking advantage of open-source...

But they're forced to speed up the improvement of their paid services to compete with their free
alternatives. In the end, then, it's a win/win situation for everyone.

I love to spend time on GitHub looking for new open-source software I can integrate into my
businesses and things I can use to help my clients. Below are some of the resources I use when on
the hunt.

## Evaluating new technologies

When choosing if I integrate a **new technology** into Our Stack I put it through the following
checklist and rate it with a score.

This gives me confidence moving forward that I haven't made an impulse 'buy'.
