met: "We met while working for a blockchain company called Skycoin in 2018. My job description wasn't very clear... sometimes I'd write articles, record videos, manage communities, attend conferences and even code a little bit. We formed a good relationship as I moved into management. After I parted from Skycoin he asked me to co-found a company with him. Since then we have worked together."
