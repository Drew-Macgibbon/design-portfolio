***Preface***

Although I'd like to think this is a showcase of my best work, this fellow has been pestering me during the day and I'm still shaking off some pretty bad jetlag.

 Not to mention working from my laptop on my brother's couch instead of at my workstation.


Excuses aside :sweat_smile: this is a meta-portfolio of sorts. You're able to track my work efforts from start to finish as I attempt to complete the to-do list in 48 hours.

I'll document the process of completing each task and estimate/show the time taken, this should give you an idea of my abilities.

**START TIME: 1:28 AM, 12/02/2022**

***Full disclosure, the basic setup of this portfolio was completed before the 48 hours began***

After starting strong things have ground to a slow pace as I experienced some laptop issues.

Thankfully, after some surgery, we're moving forward again. Unfortunately, I lost almost a day of working time!

Because of this, I've decided to slightly alter the premise of this portfolio. ***Instead of 48 clock hours, it will be 48 work hours.***
