### Technologies Used

- [Fontawesome icons]() | added while working on the patterns page, was my first time using it with Nuxt 3
- [Vercel](): Vercel is a great platform for hosting Nuxt 3 projects.
- [Storybook]() | I had minimal exposure to Storybook and no experience with Nuxt 3, so this was a good addition to my skill set.
- [Github API]() | 
- [Spotify API]()
- [Supabase]()
- [Vue Search]()
