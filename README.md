# Mac's Portfolio

***Preface***

Although I'd like to think this is a showcase of my best work, this fellow has been pestering me during the day and I'm still shaking off some pretty bad jetlag.

 Not to mention working from my laptop on my brothers couch instead of at my workstation.



Excuses aside :/ this is a meta-portfolio of sorts. You're able to track my work efforts from start to finish as I attempt to complete all the to-do checklists items in the shortest amount of time.

I'll document the process of completing each task and estimate/show the time taken, this should give you an idea of my abilities.

Once live, my portfolio will be [here](https://mltech.ltd)
