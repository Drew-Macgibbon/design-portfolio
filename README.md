## Outline

This portfolio is a **work in progress**, but that's the whole point!
I'll do my best to document the of process creating the website and estimate how long each task will take to complete. 
This should give you an idea of my development abilities and how quickly I can get things done. 

I've allocated myself 200 hours to create the best portfolio I can. (with my current abilities)
These 200 hours will be broken into 4 sprints of roughly 50 hours each.
Each sprint (Doom difficulty level) contains a slightly more challenging workload, with the intent of forcing me to fail!

1. I’m Too Young to Die
2. Hurt Me Plenty
3. Ultra Violence
4. Nightmare

If I don't fail, I coasted... that won't happen!

**Full disclosure**, the basic setup of this portfolio was completed before I began working on the **I’m Too Young to Die** sprint.

The first sprint was riddled with challenges, I experienced some laptop issues and was working from my laptop mostly on my brother's couch. I was about 30% less productive without an extra screen, my powerful machine, and a comfy chair in a distraction free room.

### Technologies I learned along the way

- [Flowbite]() | A library of Tailwind elements, I learned how to integrate the library with Nuxt only to switch out my mobile menu for my own design.
- [Fontawesome icons]() | added while working on the patterns page, was my first time using it with Nuxt 3
- [Digitalocean App Platform]() | Although I wound up using Render in the end, due to DO having issues with Nuxt 3... I still learned a decent amount about the platform and will likely use it again in the future.
- [Storybook]() | I had minimal exposure to Storybook and no experience with Nuxt 3, so this was a good addition to my skill set.
- [Lotties]() | This was my first time using this [lottie package]() and definitely the most I'd worked with Lotties.
- [Spotify API]()
- [Supabase]()
- [Vue Search]()
